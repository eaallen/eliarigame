# Project Overview
Eli and Seth created a super beta application for the Bean Life Science Museum, working with Dr. Michael Whiting and various life science undergraduate students. Dr. Whiting, the new director of the museum, is opening a new COVID-19 exhibit and hopes to help educate students and families on the virus that changed our generation. 

Eli and Seth worked vigorously on this application, diving into new territories yet to be discussed in their experience as student developers. The application they created works with physical iBeacon devices to determine proximity between the iBeacon and the iUser. Then, augmented reality objects are displayed according to the position of the user to the iBeacon. 

Eli and Seth demonstrated this application to Dr. Whiting and other students and received amazing feedback on their progress thus far. Dr. Whiting has high ambitions for this project and believes it will be a key player in gaining more traffic at the Bean Museum. 

# Challenges

One of the biggest challenges we faced was collaborating with each other on git. At first, we started using GitHub because of our familiarity with it. After hours of trying to merge our branches into the main branch, we finally started a new repository and entrusted our project to the git controls built into XCode. We had much more success with this, but still ran into issues daily. 

We had some challenges setting up the task data model and decoding/encoding JSON data. Once this was working it was smooth sailing though. 

Allowing iBeacons to control the state of the view was also difficult. Eli is a stud and didnâ€™t give up though, so we have a solution that works.
